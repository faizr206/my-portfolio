# My Portfolio Website

## Access Method

I've decided to deploy my website externally on github.

**Github Pages**: https://faizr206.github.io/my-portfolio/

## Site Overview & Audience

This portfolio website is designed as a **personal showcase** to present my skills, projects, and background in a clear and engaging way. The goal is to create a simple but professional digital presence that can be shared with peers, instructors, and potential collaborators.

The audience includes **instructors**, **classmates**, **friends**, and potentially **future employers** who want to quickly understand my work and interests. The site highlights who I am, what I’ve built, and what I aim to do in the future.

## Site Map

The website is a **single-page application** with multiple sections:

- **Hero Section** → Greeting with a typing effect in multiple languages.
- **About** → A short introduction about me and what tool I have learned so far.
- **Projects** → A showcase of selected projects with brief descriptions and links.
- **Skills** → A showcase of some of my skills as well as the framework/platform that i use.

Navigation links in the header scroll smoothly to each section. There is also a footer containing my social media such as instagram and linkedin.

## Design Notes

- Built with **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI** for a clean and modern UI.
- Color palette and typography were chosen for a **professional yet approachable** feel.
- The typing effect in multiple languages makes the site more **dynamic and personal**.
- Sections are kept minimal to focus attention on key information.
